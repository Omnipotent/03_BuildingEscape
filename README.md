### Intro, Notes & Section 3 Assets ###

+ Welcome to our first Unreal editor section.
+ You’ll learn simple level building.
+ We’ll be using meshes and materials.
+ C++ events accessed from Blueprint.
+ Calling C++ code from Blueprint.
+ And much more.

### S03 Game Design Document (GDD) ###

The Concept, Rules and Requirements of our simple game.

### Version Control 101 ###

+ The what and why of Version Control Systems
+ Choosing your Version Control System (VCS)
+ What files to include / exclude
+ Commit = save a local snapshot
+ Reset = roll-back to a previous state
+ Branch, Push and Large File Support later.

### Ignoring Unreal Derived Files ###

+ Derived files can be easily rebuilt
+ Other files (code, assets, level layout etc) can’t
+ Ignore most derived files for version control
+ Which folders to ignore in version control
+ Our starting .gitignore file for Unreal.

### Your First .gitignore for Unreal ###

+ Understand Unreal creates VS projects for us
+ How to re-generate VS project files
+ Writing our first .gitignore file
+ “Committing” our project for the first time.

### Getting to Know Unreal’s Editor ###

+ Why changes to the starter scene aren’t tracked
+ Arranging a simple set of windows
+ Moving around in the 3D Viewport
+ Setting our start map, and committing

### A Pointers Primer ###

+ You’re about to meet pointers for the first time
+ The clue is when you see a **\*** next to a type
+ Pointers are simply memory addresses
+ You have to “follow” the pointer to the object
+ Benefit: saves you from moving things in memory
+ Disadvantage: you can lose control of data.

### Unreal’s Class System ###

+ Introducing the idea of inheritance
+ Unreal’s scarily powerful class system
+ Exploring using the Class Viewer
+ Inheritance for “is a” relationships
+ Components for “has a” relationships.

### Runtime Messages for Feedback ###

+ Using **UE_LOG** to print to the Output Console
+ Printing to the game screen

**Useful Links**
+ [Epic Wiki - Logs, Printing Messages to Yourself During Runtime](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Logs,_Printing_Messages_To_Yourself_During_Runtime#Related_Tutorial_)

### Accessing Object Names ###

+ Use **GetOwner()** to find the component’s owner
+ **\*AActor** is a pointer to an actor, a new concept
+ Use -**>** to access methods through pointers
+ Use **GetName()** to find the object’s name
+ Use **%s** as a format operator for strings
+ Use **\*** to “dereference” pointers.

### Getting Transforms in C++ ###

+ Introducing **FVector**
+ Mixing **.** and **->** to access methods
+ Using multiple format operators
+ Finishing our **PositionReport** component.

### Moving Objects With C++ ###

+ A little more about the editor & temporary actors
+ How to eject yourself from the possessed pawn
+ Snapping objects to the floor (END key)
+ Using the **FRotator** struct to represent rotation
+ Use **SetActorRotation()** to rotate objects.

### Laying Out Geometry ###

+ A brief intro of BSP “vs” Static Meshes
+ Use **Q, W, E** keys to translate, rotate, scale
+ Make good use of grid snapping and quad view
+ Hold **ALT + drag** translate to duplicate an object
+ Hold **L** and double-click for temporary work Light
+ This is fiddly, try letting go of **L** and trying again.

### Applying Materials ###

+ A material is comprised of texture(s) and shader(s)
+ Textures are image files, shaders are GPU code
+ Unreal ships with some impressive examples
+ Unreal has powerful material editing tools
+ Applying materials to our room interior.

### Macros Starting with UPROPERTY ###

+ A macro is a programmed cut-and-paste
+ This happens before the code is compiled
+ Can unlock powerful functionality
+ We don’t get code complete as standard
+ Can also create really weird build errors
+ Expose **ATriggerVolume\*** to the Details window

### Using Trigger Volumes ###

+ A trigger volume is a very versatile tool
+ A 3D volume that detects things entering / leaving
+ We’re going to use one as a pressure plate
+ How we’re going to specify what can open doors
+ Use **IsOverlappingActor()** on **ATriggerVolume**
+ Polling vs using events.

### Unreal’s PlayerController ###

+ We’ve used **GetOwner()** to search “bottom-up”
+ Now let’s use **GetWorld()** to search “top-down”
+ Game Mode specifies the Default Pawn Class
+ The Default Pawn is your “body”, is transient
+ The Player Controller is your “mind”, persist
+ PlayerController class has **GetPawn()**

### Using Collision Volumes ###

+ Collisions volumes are also known as colliders
+ These tell the physics engine what hits what
+ A trigger volume just triggers code
+ A collider actually has physics simulated
+ Exploring how to add collision volumes
+ Prevent players from passing through the door!

### Using GetTimeSeconds() ###

+ Using **GetWord()->GetTimeSeconds()**
+ Making our game highly “play tunable”
+ Re-factoring our code for simplicity
+ Using a spotlight to provide “affordance”
+ Play-testing to ensure the game is annoying!

### Grabbing System Overview ###

+ We want to be able to lift the chair next
+ We’ll add a **Grabber.cpp** component to the player
+ The player is a temporary actor, appears on play
+ The Game Mode sets which Default Pawn to use
+ Create Default Pawn & Game Mode Blueprints
+ Specify our modified Default Pawn.

### Modifying the Default Pawn Actor ###

+ Why Blueprint is helpful in this case
+ How to make a Blueprint from the Default Pawn
+ Note this Blueprint class inherits, an “is a” relation
+ A Blueprint is like a template
+ You make an “instance” in the scene
+ Explore “instantiating” from Blueprint & modifying.

### Inherit Game Mode Blueprint ###

+ “Hard coding” means assets written into code
+ The DefaultPawn_BP is an asset
+ We want to be able to track changes to its name
+ It is convenient to use Blueprint for this purpose
+ Extending our C++ Game Mode with Blueprint
+ Selecting the new DefaultPawn_BP

### Getting Player Viewpoint ###

+ Know where the player is looking
+ Out-parameters can be confusing
+ A way of marking-up out parameters
+ Continuously logging player viewpoint.

### Using DrawDebugLine ###

+ How to add vectors
+ Calculating our line trace end point
+ Using debug functions for visualisation in Unreal
+ Use DrawDebugLine() to visualise the vectors.

### Line Tracing AKA Ray-Casting ###

+ Line tracing (AKA ray casting) is a very useful tool
+ Imagine we shine a virtual laser into the world
+ We can use different view modes to visualise
+ Simulating physics sets the object channel.

### LineTraceSingleByObjectType() ###

+ Meet references for the first time
+ LineTraceSingle may be deprecated
+ Build params inc. FCollisionQueryParams

### REFERENCES & POINTERS ###

+ How references and pointers compare
+ How to perform common operations in both
+ What the & and * symbols means in context
+ Challenge: Repoint and Rewrite
+ When to use references over pointers?

### Resetting Your Unreal Project ###

+ What to do if your Unreal solution keeps crashing
+ How to delete all temporary files
+ The order in which to reset things

### Using FindComponentByClass() ###

+ What FindComponentByClass() does
+ How to use it to find attached components
+ Introducing angle brackets <> for generics
+ Use nullptr to initialise your pointers
+ Log a useful error if the component isn’t attached.

### Introducing Input Binding ###

+ Settings > Project Settings > Engine > Input
+ Action mappings are used for on / off actions
+ Axis mappings are used for analog values
+ You can give players a way or re-mapping
+ Many keys can bind to one action
+ How to call a function on a key press or release

### Accessors & Memory Layout ###

+ How the arrow, dot and **::** accessors work
+ Introducing virtual memory
+ Introducing permanent storage, stack & heap
+ Heap is also known as free store
+ How accessor operators relate to memory
+ Bind another input action

### Reducing Code in “Hot Loops” ###

+ A “hot loop” is code that get called often
+ **TickComponent** is a good example, every frame
+ Beware of code that you know will be called a lot
+ Make it clear what happens every tick
+ Refactor our code for speed...
+ ...and make it ready for for the physics handle.

### Using Physics Handles ###

+ Unreal provides a Physics Handle that’s ideal here
+ The Physics Handle component docs are scant\*
+ Find an example of its use in the engine
+ Get the physics handle working.

**Useful Links**

+ [Unreal Engine API Reference - UPhysicsHandleComponent](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/Engine/PhysicsEngine/UPhysicsHandleComponent/)

### Refactoring Rules ###

+ Using multiple getters for multiple return values
+ Less lines of clear code is better (143 at start)
+ Naming is really important, take the time
+ Comment the “why”, don’t assume it’s obvious
+ The “what” should be obvious...
+ … but it can be helpful to add clarification

### Introducing Unreal’s TArray ###

+ A **TArray** is Unreal’s go-to container class
+ Use to contain many elements of same type
+ We’ll use to contain all actors on pressure plate
+ Give our Default Pawn an eye-height and mass
+ Making our pressure-plate based on total mass.

### Iterating over TArray with for ###

+ Using **auto&** as an auto reference type
+ Automatically iterating over a **TArray**
+ Pattern: **for (const auto\* Iterator : Array)**
+ How to find an actor’s mass
+ Tweaking and testing our mass values.

### Debugging Game Issues ###

+ Are you using source control? If not start now
+ You can “binary search” commits quite fast
+ For example 1024 commits takes max 10 tries!
+ Think “what changed” and “possible side-effects”
+ Remember you can eject with F8 during play.

### Managing Texture Tiling ###

+ You may want to re-size objects (e.g. panels)
+ Doing so will stretch the texture
+ You can re-scale a few ways
+ One way is in the material blueprint
+ UV mapping because we ran out of letters!
+ Using the TexCoord node in the material editor.

### Pointer Protection Process ###

+ Horrible crashes when we follow a nullptr
+ We must always check pointers before use
+ When declaring always initialise to nullptr
+ Look for * in your .h files to help find pointers
+ Also check before every use and handle nullptr
+ Sometimes we may chose not to, e.g. Owner.

### Exposing Events to Blueprint ###

+ Sometimes Blueprint’s the better choice
+ For example defining our door swing as a curve
+ We can create an event called **OnOpenRequest**
+ Using **UPROPERTY (BlueprintAssignable)**

### Using Blueprint Timeline ###

+ The Timeline node in Blueprint has a curve editor
+ This is ideal for defining our door movement
+ How to use Timeline curves in Blueprint
+ Setting rotation from a Timeline.

### Everything in its Place ###

+ Using Blueprint has superseded some code
+ It’s important there’s only 1 place per parameter
+ Creating a 2nd event: **OnClose**

### Using Variables in Blueprint ###

+ Not all doors have the same absolute rotation
+ We want to store the door’s rotation at the start
+ … then use this value to make a relative rotation
+ We can use Blueprint variables for this
+ Making doors that face any direction work.

### SFX & Audio Clips ###

+ We’re going to trigger a simple sound in Blueprint
+ Later in the course we’ll use C++ too
+ However we’ll always reference our assets via BP
+ How to trigger a 3D sound.

### Section 3 Wrap-Up ###

+ Congratulations on another complete section
+ You’ve learnt so much, look at the lecture titles
+ Please carry-on a little on your own and share
+ Attached are useful resources
+ Start the next section as soon as you’re finished.
